# Trello YouTube Power-Up

This is a Trello Power-Up for embedding YouTube videos in your cards. It was forked from Trello's power-up-template project which you can find here (https://trello.github.io/power-up-template).

Want to try this Power-Up right away without waiting? Go ahead and grab the manifest URL (https://amberream.github.io/youtube-power-up/manifest.json). If you've forked it, you should grab your fork's manifest URL. And then head here:

ðŸ‘‰  [https://trello.com/power-ups/admin](https://trello.com/power-ups/admin)

Select the Trello team you want to add the Power-Up to. Note: You need to be an admin of the Trello team to add custom Power-Ups to it.

Now click the `Create new Power-Up` button. If this is your first time creating a Power-Up, you'll need to agree to a "Joint Developer Agreement" first. After you have done that, you just need to give your cool new Power-Up a name, and paste the manifest url link in (the one you created earlier).

Click `Save` and it's time to celebrate ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽŠ

Now when you look at the Power-Ups for any board in that team, your awesome new Power-Up will be available. All changes you commit and push to the repo will be reflected in the Power-Up!
